            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Select one golfer each week....each golfer can only be used once during the season and cannot be re-used if they miss the cut the first time you chose them</li>
              <li>Dollars earned by your player each week is our points system--if they miss the cut, you earn $0 that week.  So bigger purse tournaments are more important than smaller ones</li>
              <li>The 2016 PGA Tour is split in to quarters and the winner from each quarter will face off in the final Championship. (Final 4 events)</li>
              <li>Top players in each quarter will win prize money with the championship being the biggest pot</li>
              <li>Picks are made on the website or emailed to <a href="mailto:erickambestad@yahoo.com">erickambestad@yahoo.com</a>. If you are unable to login that week. Picks are <strong>DUE BY MIDNIGHT THE NIGHT PRIOR TO THE TOURNAMENT START</strong> (most often midnight Wednesday night....a few tournaments start on Wednesday and in those cases, your pick is due Tuesday midnight)</li>
              <li><strong>Entry fee is due by March 1</strong> and if you haven't paid by then, your picks will not be accepted further until you pay.. please don't do that though.  Confrontation makes me uncomfortable.
